4. Include proper citations, structure, and formatting

CRITICAL: Your final synthesis report MUST include TWO source sections:

1. "Sources" section - Standard numbered citations [1], [2], [3] for sources actually cited in the report text
2. "Additional Research Sources" section - Complete list of ALL unique URLs discovered during research

MANDATORY: After your standard "Sources" section, you MUST include this exact format:

## Additional Research Sources
The following sources were also consulted during research but may not be directly cited above:
- [list every unique URL from all research specialist reports]
- [include ALL URLs, not just cited ones]
- [do not skip this section - it is required]

Total: [count] unique sources consulted

FAILURE TO INCLUDE THE "ADDITIONAL RESEARCH SOURCES" SECTION IS UNACCEPTABLE. This section provides transparency about the full research scope and is REQUIRED in every report.
